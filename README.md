# Sprint-Review-and-Retrospective

    How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this
I feel like you first need to understand the fundamentals of software development, which will help you break down any complex requirements and make them manageable.When you add in the Agile methodologies it will provide a flexible framework to go by. Understanding the roles and responisblities will help delevop the dream dream to complete any projects. User feedback can improve and validate the requirements for the end goal. We also want to ensure we are not missing anything that the customer wants. 

    How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
When developing a program or project I tend to seem myself breaking it down into smaller groups. As a product Owner I set the backlog and schedule to have it done. Breaking into small groups allows the team to see the progress with each step. Some key practices that I will contiue to use would be to have daily stand-up meeting and sprint planning. To have clear communication  throughout all team members. And to also take the feedback given and make the changes. I would use Kanban framework to outline the project and track process. 
    
    What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a good team member in software development go above the technical skills, You will also need to know how to communicate with each team memebers. Having the technical skill will help but I feel like you can learn that along the way. A good team member include taking responsibility for their own work and to be open about feedback. Begin able to solve their own problem and if they do not know how to ask for help.
